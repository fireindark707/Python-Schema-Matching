"FACT CHECK: CPP-NPA concocted the term ‘red-tagging,’ PNA article claims","An article published by the Philippine News Agency (PNA) asserted that the term “red-tagging” was concocted and is being used by the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) to protect their so-called “legal fronts.”

The article quoted Cristoni Latiban Monzon, who introduced himself in the article as a rebel returnee. “Red tagging is a word used by the communist group to cover and protect its legal fronts which the Commission on Election has unwittingly accredited via the party-list system,” Monzon was reported as saying in a recent virtual press briefing hosted by the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC).

CLAIM:

CPP-NPA concocted the term ‘red-tagging.’

RATING:

FALSE

FACTS:

Red-tagging is neither an invention by the CPP-NPA nor did it originate from the Philippines. “Red-tagging’s roots are not Filipino but American, where the term ‘red scare’ is sometimes used,” remarked Filipino anthropologist Michael Tan in his column in the Philippine Daily Inquirer.

Tan explained that the first “red scare” came after the Bolshevik victory in 1917 and the eventual establishment of the Soviet Union headed by Russia. “The US saw the new powerful communist state as a threat to American capitalism,” Tan stated.

With the onset of World War II – and well into the 1950s – the rivalry of the US and the Soviet Union intensified and this contributed to the intensification of anti-communist paranoia and the red scare.

In an article in Jezebel, historian Kathryn Olmstead of the University of California explained that the practice of “red-baiting” or tagging individuals and groups as communists became a widespread form of attack during the administration of Franklin Roosevelt when he started the New Deal, a series of government programs meant to help and protect labor workers and their unions. Herbert Hoover, who lost to Roosevelt during the 1932 elections, rallied conservatives into denouncing the New Deal, which he equated to socialism and communism.

The practice of tagging government opposition as communists reached the Philippines as early as 1949 when the government formed the Committee on Un-Filipino Activities (CUFA) to go after the CPP and the Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon (Hukbalahap) and their supposed sympathizers.

Red-tagging intensified during the Marcos administration when former Sen. Benigno S. Aquino Jr. – known critic of Ferdinand Marcos Sr. – was red-tagged and accused of colluding with NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno, also known as “Commander Dante, and policeman turned guerrilla Lt. Victor Corpus. After getting red-tagged, Aquino was sentenced to death by firing squad for charges of subversion, murder and illegal possession of firearms.

WHY THIS MATTERS:

According to the United Nations News, red-tagging has become a vicious form of attack that criminalizes discourse, undermines the work of human rights defenders, and puts them at risk of violence. Several civil society organizations have also stressed that red-tagging is a potential death sentence. Human rights organization Karapatan has documented at least 78 people who were killed as a result of either red-tagging or anti-terrorism police operations in recent years. –Shem Peter Acal and Richmond Sapasap

"FACT CHECK: Did late dictator Marcos ban child labor?","A TikTok video re-uploaded by the Facebook page ‘Uniteam Bbm-Sara’ listed a series of claims that sought to compare how the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos addressed several issues during his term, to how his successors fared. At the 00:29 mark in the TikTok video, it claimed that Marcos banned child labor during his term, an issue other presidents supposedly failed to address.

RATING:

FALSE

FACTS:

Contrary to the video’s claim, Marcos himself issued Presidential Decree (PD) 148 in 1973, which legally allowed children aged 14-18 years to work.

Since 1948, the Philippines has been a part of the International Labour Organization (ILO), which passed the Minimum Age Convention in 1973. Instead of pushing the Philippine government to ratify the 15-year-old minimum age set by the convention, Marcos issued PD 148 which set the minimum age of employment at 14 to supposedly curb the economic decline during that time.

By 1974, PD 148 was amended with the enactment of Presidential Decree 442 or the Labor Code of the Philippines, which raised the age of employment from 14 years to 15 years, in compliance with the ILO. However, the Labor Code did not contain enough terms and conditions that could sufficiently protect children from prematurely entering the workforce.

The Philippines only ratified the ILO Minimum Age Convention in 1998, 12 years after Marcos was ousted.

WHY THIS MATTERS:

Not one Philippine administration has effectively abolished child labor. In a paper released by the US Department of Labor in 2019, it was noted that while the Philippines made “moderate advancement” in tackling child labor, with the country being able to enact several laws and regulations addressing the issue in the past years, child labor remains prevalent, as a result of poor law enforcement and worsening economic conditions. –Maez Estrada and Joseph Gloria

"‘Backdoor for the rich’: Poll watchdog releases full report on party-lists","Philippine-based election watchdog Kontra Daya has released its full research on the background of party-list groups participating in the 2022 national elections.

Based on their findings, the group said majority of the party-lists are not representing the poor and have questionable backgrounds that go against the intent of the party-list system.

Out of 177, it identified 124 — or 70% of the party-list groups as having unclear representations and advocacies; having links to political clans, big business, government or military; or have nominees facing pending cases in court.

The research, spanning 37 pages, was a product of a team of researchers who grouped the party-lists and assigned each member to do deep background investigation.

The researchers looked at the particular party-list’s track record from publicly available information, their declared advocacies, and background of nominees. The also searched for issues surrounding each party-list group and its candidates.

Red flags

Kontra Daya labeled some party-list groups with multiple red flags. Party-list groups that allegedly raised at least three concerns include WOW Pilipinas, Maagap, ACT-CIS, TGP, BHW, PTA, Duterte Youth, CWS, MayPagasa, PVAID, and IPEACE EPANAW.

It also flagged party-lists ACT-CIS, 4P’s, BHW, Mocha, and Abante Sambayanan for their reported multiple links to interest groups.

This year’s figures mark a huge increase from Kontra Daya’s findings in the 2019 elections, which convenor Danilo Arao said was roughly only half or 50% of the party-list groups at the time.

Arao said that the Commission on Elections (Comelec) would justify through the years that it was just following the law and the interpretation of the Supreme Court. With this, he said, practically anyone can run as a party-list nominee without belonging to a marginalized sector as long as they claim to champion the rights of the poor.

“Ang hindi masyadong naipaliliwanag sa publiko, mayroong quasi-judicial at quasi-legislative function ang Comelec. Pwede naman niyang i-interpret ang batas nang naaayon doon sa intent ng pagkakabuo nito,” Arao told DZXL 558’s Meet The Boss on March 4.

“Kasi kahit tanungin niyo ang mga framer ng Constitution at mismong gumawa ng Party-List System Act of 1995, sinasabi nila na dapat binibigyan ng kaukulang espasyo ang mga marginalized and underrepresented,” he added.

“Pero ngayon ang nakakapagtaka, under the party-list system, ang nama-marginalize ay ang mga marginalized.”

Kontra Daya, in an earlier statement, said that the country’s party-list system continues to be “hijacked by the rich and powerful”. “They are being used as a backdoor to further entrench the political and economic interests of the rich,” the group said.

With the corruption of the party-list system, some camps have called for its abolition. But Arao said that the most reasonable solution is to amend the party-list law to reflect its original intent: giving genuine representation to the marginalized and underrepresented sectors in Congress.

“Public pressure is necessary for Congress to pass these amendments,” he said.

"Robredo commits to peace talks resumption","Vice President Leni Robredo is committed to resume formal peace negotiations with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) if she wins in the May polls, according to her spokesperson Atty. Barry Gutierrez.

Representing Robredo in the third episode of the Peace and Presidentiables webinar series organized by the Citizen’s Alliance for Just Peace (CAJP), Gutierrez assured that a Robredo administration would call for the resumption of the NDFP with the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP).

A Robredo presidency would avoid militaristic and top-down strategies in favor of enabling marginalized sectors to have a role in governance and decision-making processes, including peace negotiations, Gutierrez added.

Robredo would re-engage communities and basic sectors to create a more conducive environment for peaceful negotiations, he said.

Gutierrez outlined five principles in the pursuit of this goal: the rejection of a purely militaristic approach; strong participation of communities and local stakeholders in the peace process; the primacy of protecting civilians from violence; a peace framework that is in line with national socioeconomic goals and social justice; and, the strategic role of international community, including longstanding partners such as the Royal Norwegian Government.

Reaffirmation of previous agreements

Robredo’s spokesperson also promised that she would uphold the milestone documents previously signed by the GRP and the NDFP.

These agreements include The Hague Joint Declaration, the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (JASIG), and the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL).

On the Comprehensive Agreement on Social and Economic Reforms (CASER), which was jointly drafted and was ready for approval in 2017, Gutierrez said that economic and social reforms should be fundamental to the peace process.

Robredo on the NTF-ELCAC

Gutierrez also clarified Robredo’s stance on the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC), saying the Vice President believes that the original intention behind the agency was sound but the implementation of its mandate was marred by abuses.

If the NTF-ELCAC were to be abolished, it would have to be replaced by a body that would pursue the “whole-of-nation approach” while upholding democratic principles, he said.

Gutierrez also explained that Robredo’s support for the “whole-of-nation approach” was not an endorsement of the NTF-ELCAC’s abuses, but an espousal of the idea that the insurgency has to be solved by including all aspects of national governance to address the root causes of the insurgency.

Robredo vowed to put an end to acts of harassment by the NTF-ELCAC, such as in the form of red-tagging, Gutierrez assured, the Vice President being a victim of red-tagging by officials of the NTF-ELCAC herself.

Robredo is also open to revisiting controversial provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020.

According to Gutierrez, Robredo will also be amenable to a reassessment of the terrorist designation of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and the New People’s Army (NPA) as so-called terrorist organizations.

Robredo shall also initiate a review of the cases of political prisoners, including jailed NDFP peace consultants, to facilitate their release.

More presidentiables for talks

Earlier, Robredo’s rival for the presidency, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, also said he is amenable to a review of the CPP, NPA and NDFP’s designation as so-called terrorist organizations as part of the creation of an atmosphere for the resumption of formal peace negotiations.

“Basta ako, yung peace talks, we must seek for it as much as possible. Not only the Communist Party but those other,” Moreno, during a campaign sortie in Lucena last Monday, said.

(For me, we must seek peace talks as much as possible. Not only with the CPP, but with other armed groups.)

Moreno served as NDFP Negotiating Panel resource person during talks between the Rodrigo Duterte GRP and the NDFP in 2016 and 2017.

Senator Manny Pacquaio and labor leader Leody de Guzman also said they will resume formal peace negotiations with the NDFP in the first two episodes of CAJP’s forum.

The Peace and the Presidentiable forum is organized in cooperation with the Lasallian Justice and Peace Commission of the De La Salle schools; Father Saturnino Urios University; Silliman University Student Council; St. Scholastica’s College, Manila; and, the University of the Philippines.

More NDFP consultant disappeared

Meanwhile, human rights group Karapatan sounded an alarm over the disappearance of NDFP peace consultants Ezequiel Daguman and Edwin Alcid.

NDFP consultant Ramon Patriarca, already a former political prisoner, was arrested in Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental last March 18, along with youth activists CJ Matarlo and John Michael Tecson were.

Karapatan has no details of the charges against Patriarca and companions.

“We assert the calls to surface Edwin Alcid and Ezequiel Daguman and to free Esteban Manuel Jr. and Ramon Patriarca now! These attacks on peace consultants and advocates must stop! We strongly urge the Philippine government and the NDFP to resume the peace talks as soon as possible for the sake of our people,” Palabay demanded.

Palabay reminded the government that peace consultants are covered by the (JASIG) that states peace consultants and peace panel members should be immune from arrests, detention, and harassment.

Despite the suspension of formal peace talks between the Philippine government and the NDFP, JASIG has not been formally terminated by both parties, she said.

Palabay said that the recent string of abductions and arrests of NDFP peace consultants “signal intensified attacks — and of worst things to come, especially with the Duterte administration’s self-imposed deadline to wipe out the NDFP. We can only expect the arrests, abductions, and even killings of peace consultants and advocates.”

“Our people deserve genuine peace. These attacks not only spoil efforts to advance just peace but instead perpetuates militarism, violence, and injustice. As we assert our calls to surface Edwin Alcid and Ezequiel Daguman and to free Esteban Manuel Jr. and Ramon Patriarca, we also call for the immediate resumption of the peace talks and to stop the attacks on peace consultants,” Palabay said. # Raymund B.

"Cordillera farmers bat for inclusion of vegetable gardeners in DA’s fuel subsidy","Originally published on Rappler.com on March 22, 2022, under the Aries Rufo Journalism Fellowship program.

BAGUIO CITY, Philippines — A farmers’ alliance in the Cordillera called on the government to expand the Department of Agriculture’s fuel subsidy for farmers and fisherfolk to include vegetable “gardeners” (small vegetable producers).

In a March 21 text message, Fernando Bagyan of Alyansa dagiti Pesante iti Taeng Kordilyera (Alliance of Peasants in the Cordillera Homeland) said the government should include vegetable gardeners in the fuel subsidy.

“Gardinero ti mangbakbaklay iti kadagsenan a transport cost gaputa 100% a gastosda ti panangbiahe ingga ti trading post… Nangina ti transport cost ditoy kabanbantayan dapu ti kasasaad ti kalsada,” he said.

(Farmers carry the heaviest burden because they shoulder all transport costs to the trading post… The state of road networks in the mountains makes transportation costs higher.)

While most farmers in the vegetable area are not using farm machines, he said, many utilize their vehicles to transport their products.

“Ina-assume siguro ng gobyerno na mas truckers ang gumagastos pero marami na sa mga gardinero ang may sariling sasakyan at nagdadala sa trading post. Papaano na sila?” Bagyan said.

(Maybe the government assumes that the truckers spend more, but many farmers already have their vehicles and bring their produce to the trading post. What will happen to them now?)

Benguet Vegetable Truckers and Traders Association president Rudy Bulawan said they imposed a P0.50 per kilo increase in delivery charges on March 16. He explained that additional charge is a last resort and needed for them to survive.

When fuel was still at around P50 per liter, Bulawan and his members implemented alternate and combined trips due to the drop in demand. However, the arrangement failed to soften their losses with the continued fuel price hikes.

With every oil price hike, the mounting fuel prices hit Benguet vegetable farmers hard, with production and transport costs rising. Meanwhile, farmgate prices of their products have not increased significantly, which traders and farmers attribute to the low demand and rampant vegetable smuggling.

The government has set aside a P1.1-billion fuel subsidy for farmers. Agriculture Secretary William Dar confirmed that aside from the P500 million allotted in their budget, President Rodrigo Duterte also approved P600 million more for fuel discounts. However, the subsidy only covers corn farmers and fisherfolk using motorized boats.

At the sidelines of the Benguet Farmer’s Summit on March 16, Benguet Legislative Caretaker Eric Yap said he would appeal to Dar to include vegetable farmers.

“Kung hindi man sila masama, ilalagay natin silang [beneficiary] sa DSWD dahil meron pa naming pondo doon. Yun ang nakikita nating solusyon diyan upang mabigyan din sila ng ayuda mula sa national government,” he said.

(If they are not included, we will put them as the beneficiaries of the DSWD because there are still funds there. This is the solution we see so that they can get assistance from the national government.)

He said the House of Representatives is also finding ways to increase the subsidies.

“Actually, yang fuel subsidy [sa transport] ay sa NCR lang, kaya pinapasama ko din sana yung mga truckers dito sa Benguet kasi sila yung mga naghahakot ng mga vegetables. Kung mabibigyan sila ng subsidy, mabibigyan din nila ng discount yung mga farmers sa hauling cost nila,” Yap said.

(The fuel subsidy for transport is actually for NCR only, so we are trying to include Benguet Truckers because they are the ones delivering vegetables. If they receive subsidies, they can give discounts to farmers for their hauling cost.)

In the same event, Benguet Governor Melchor Diclas said they would check the provincial funds to see if they could also provide financial aid to cushion the impact of the fuel prices.

“Kitkitaen tayo met diay pondo ti provincial government ta barbareng nga adda met ti pondo tayo idiay disaster. Ngem kitakitaek no adda maited from Congress ken adda maited ti DA, umanayen siguro daydiay ta ireservetayo diay pondo tayo for other calamities,” he said.

(We are looking into possible fund sources from the provincial government. Maybe we could spare some from our disaster response funds. But we are also looking into possible funds from Congress and DA; that should be enough so we could save our disaster response funds for other calamities.) # Sherwin de Vera/nordis.net

"Lumad leader arrested in Arakan, North Cotabato","MANILA – A Lumad council leader was arrested by state forces last March 18, Friday.

In a statement, the Save Our Schools Network said that Lumad leader Edwin Oribawan Sr. was arrested by combined forces of the Philippine National Police and the 72nd Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army at 4:00 a.m. in sitio Aguila, Kabalantian, Arakan, North Cotabato.

The group said authorities forcibly entered the residence of Oribawan, threatening his daughter and two other children.

“They held them at gunpoint while asking about their father’s whereabouts. At 5:00 a.m., elements of the 72nd IBPA illegally arrested and handcuffed Oribawan. The elements of the PNP and 72nd IBPA planted bullets in order to prove their allegations,” the SOS Network said.

Oribawan was then brought to the Arakan Police Station and was reportedly charged with attempted murder, rebellion, and use of illegal drugs.

SOS said Oribawan was also instrumental in the establishment of the Mindanao Interfaith School Foundation, Inc. (MISFI) in Arakan, North Cotabato and was part of its Parents Teachers and Community Association (PTCA).

This was also not the first time that Oribawan was falsely accused by the authorities. In 2017, the SOS Network said he was falsely implicated in an ambush in sitio Gambodes.

The group condemned the illegal arrest of Oribawan.

“We also urge everyone to stand with us in condemning the intensified attacks on Lumad schools and communities,” the group said. (RTS, RVO)

"‘Red-tagging of bookstores, an attack on academic freedom, critical thinking’ – teachers","MANILA – Progressive educators decried the red-tagging of two bookstores, saying that this is another unmistakable attack on academic freedom and critical thinking.

“It is not surprising that Popular Bookstore and Solidaridad Bookshop were targeted by the latest mindless red-tagging attacks. Many generations of readers, students, and intellectuals have walked through their doors to discover rare books on the Philippines or challenging treatises that they would not find elsewhere. A malicious idiot could easily dig up one or two ‘leftist’ works buried in their shelves and triumphantly label the bookstores themselves as subversive,” said the Academics Unite for Democracy and Human Rights in a statement.

On March 22, two bookstores – Popular Bookstore in Quezon City and Solidaridad Bookshop in Manila – were vandalized, accusing them as “terrorists” and affiliated with the New People’s Army, the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines.

This comes months after the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) ordered the “purging” of books and documents that the government considers as subversive. Among the documents that state forces had removed are pamphlets on peace talks between the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP).

The NTF-ELCAC has also been on a red-tagging spree of late, including the camp of Vice President Leni Robredo over the support it is receiving from activists and progressive groups and Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong for ordering the takedown of tarpaulins that red-tag activists in the city.

The Congress of Teachers/Educators for Nationalism and Democracy said in a statement that the attack on academic freedom and critical thinking is likely the handiwork of the NTF-ELCAC.

“As book buyers and authors, we stand behind independent bookstores who served generations of students and writers in the Philippines. The upcoming elections are a decisive time to end the current administration’s fascism that wastes the people’s money on bogus agencies such as the NTF-ELCAC,” Contend said.

In a statement, the Academics Unite for Democracy and Human Rights said in light of commercialism and accessible digital information, “it has become extremely hard for bookstores to live up to the vocation of selling books with heft and substance.”

“This task becomes even harder still when the few remaining bookstores are threatened with violence for trying to live up to what a bookstore is supposed to be,” the group of professors, researchers, university administrators, and education professionals added.

Meanwhile, Rebo Press Book Publishing, an independent publishing house, said they are standing with Popular Bookstore and Solidaridad Bookshop, describing the recent attack as an attempt to “silence the intellectual freedom and freedom of expression of both authors and book consumers.”

The independent publishing house added, “As we are entering an even darker age in Philippine politics, we must all band together against the very real dangers of speaking and writing. We stand in solidarity with genuine indie publishers, artists, creatives, and cultural workers as we continue with committed writing and the necessary work for upliftment and organizing.” (JJE, RVO)

"Baguio mayor Magalong calls out Badoy to fact-check, observe due process","Originally published on Rappler.com on March 23, 2022, under the Aries Rufo Journalism Fellowship program.

BAGUIO CITY–Retired Police General and Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong urged the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) officials to check their facts and uphold due process before giving statements accusing local officials of supporting communist rebels.

During his March 22 press conference, the mayor expressed dismay for the “sudden attack,” saying NTF-ELCAC should have asked their regional counterparts about his performance as chair of the Regional Peace and Order Committee and co-chair of the regional TF-ELCAC.

“All they have to do is verify their facts. We have what we call fact-checking, due diligence, and due process. Sadly, due process was not observed, although they were saying that they were trying to get in touch with me,” Magalong lamented in mixed English and Filipino.

According to him, accusing individuals without due diligence and due process is counterproductive and “creates more radicals, especially among family members.”

He said that NTF-ELCAC officials should be “more cautious and be more circumspect otherwise all the gains of the ELCAC will be lost.”

His appeal came after PCOO Undersecretary and NTF-ELCAC Spokesperson Lorraine Badoy, in a statement, accused Magalong of betrayal and protecting front organizations of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front of the Philippines (CPP-NPA-NDFP).

Badoy, who is facing several red-tagging complaints before the Ombudsman, was reacting to Magalong’s order prohibiting posters in the city that red-tag activists, student leaders, and other Baguio personalities.

He made the directive during the March 12 dialogue with different cause-oriented groups in the city, who raised concerns about the intensified red-tagging campaign against government critics.

Magalong also assured members of the group that “as long as they are in the City of Baguio, they are safe.”

‘No right to judge’

Magalong acknowledged receiving several messages from NTF-ELCAC officials but failed to respond immediately. However, the mayor stressed that “it does not give [the NTF-ELCAC] the right to judge him immediately of betraying the country and the government.”

“It pains me that after all these years of service, fighting insurgents from the time I graduated in 1982 until I was Special Action Force, I was leading my men upfront, not from the rear, fighting this communist terrorist only to be disregarded in an instant,” he said.

The mayor explained that he has always championed good governance, including engaging all groups and listening to their concerns.

“The only way we will be able to defeat and probably the best way to defeat the insurgents is through good governance,” he said.

“And good governance is not only about the fight against corruption, it is not just about delivering the basic services, it is about innovation, it is about transformation, it is about competent leadership, it is about respect for human rights, [which] is a very strong pillar of good governance,” Magalong added.

According to him, those who attended the dialogue “have some issues with the government but they will not ally themselves with the CPP-NPA.”

“I saw them and I know some of them and it is but right to protect their human rights instead of them being displayed without due process. You will post and put them there – what will happen to their family, to their children, are we not radicalizing them?” he added.

He pointed out that the NTF-ELCAC at local governments should be partners in the campaign against the communist rebels.

“We are supposed to be partners in this campaign, we should have talked to each other, we should support each other; they should not be bullying us, they should not be attacking us, they should not be disrespecting us,” Magalong said.

“I was exposed to this attack, without due process, without due diligence, and if they can do this to me, how much more to small municipalities?” he added.

Coercing LGUs

Metro-Baguio group Tongtongan ti Umili (People’s Caucus or TTU) said Badoy’s statement showed how the NTF-ELCAC are pressuring local officials to toe the line that activist groups are fronts of CPP-NPA-NDFP.

“(T)he disgraced spokesperson now utterly disrespects the independence of the LGUs by pressuring them to sing their tune, and as usual, accusing those against their line as in cahoots with the CPP-NPA,” the statement said.

TTU and the Cordillera Human Rights Alliance (CHRA) commended Magalong for keeping true to his commitment.

“We appreciate Mayor Magalong’s daring move to diverge from the tentacles of red-tagging by assuring the safety of rights defenders and remaining open for continuous dialogue. It speaks of his character, especially when contrasted with the talking heads of the national ELCAC,” TTU stated.

“We commend the statements and actions being done by Mayor Magalong to address red tagging and other rights violations against human rights defenders in the city, but we continue to challenge him to review the State policies that legitimize such,” CHRA said. # Sherwin de Vera/nordis.net

"Breaking the Duterte-Marcos’ political hold","Recently, two groups in the Philippine Left — the the national-democratic or ND Left, the biggest in the formation, and the democratic socialist Left — have become friendlier, after decades of being cold towards each other. In response to the tyrannical regime of Rodrigo Duterte, the worst in the country’s recent history, the two groups have forged unity and cooperation on various campaigns and made statements favorable to each other.

In the 2019 mid-term elections, people’s lawyer Neri Colmenares, candidate of the ND Left’s electoral alliance Makabayang Koalisyon ng Mamamayan (Makabayan), and labor leader Leody de Guzman, candidate of the democratic socialist Left’s Partido Lakas ng Masa (PLM), ran together for the Senate under the Labor Win coalition. PLM and national labor center Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU), part of the ND Left, held parallel campaigns on wages, contractualization, and other pressing workers’ issues.

For the current 2022 elections, de Guzman, who is running for president, has repeatedly said that he is supporting the senatorial bids of Colmenares and of labor leader and KMU chair Elmer “Ka Bong” Labog, also of Makabayan. Foremost ND Left intellectual Jose Maria Sison has praised the progressive political stands taken by renowned Left intellectual Walden Bello, de Guzman’s running mate, as well as their progressive electoral platform. In a presidential debate, de Guzman said that Sison is a revolutionary and not a terrorist, contrary to the Philippine government’s accusation. In response, Sison said that de Guzman is the best presidential candidate in the 2022 elections, on the basis of his platform.

In their essay “The Philippine Left Has an Opportunity to Break the Country’s Political Mold,” however, Maria Khristine Alvarez, Joshua Makalintal, and Herbert Docena are using the de Guzman-Bello campaign to criticize the ND Left, in the course of presenting the justification for the campaign to readers of international Left publication Jacobin.

The authors argue that the de Guzman-Bello campaign diverges from the ND Left’s “lesser evil” tactic in elections that select the president and other officials of the ruling-class government. They trace this tactic to the alleged weakening of the broad Philippine Left after the ouster of the US-backed dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. They then show how this tactic has resulted in some unsavory alliances and situations for the ND Left and another Left formation in the country — the social-democratic Akbayan. Afterwards, they offer a critique of opposition presidential candidate and current vice-president Leni Robredo’s economic platform, calling her a “progressive neoliberal.”

They conclude by asserting the necessity and importance of the de Guzman-Bello candidacy which, by “bringing a revolutionary perspective to public attention and building the political and organizational infrastructure that will be needed to make such initiatives sustainable,” is salutary for the engagement of the Filipino working classes and the Philippine Left with the dominant elite politics in the country.

Only the first sentence in that summary can be stated without reservation. In all their major assertions, the authors miss the essentials and miss the point.

Attentive and discerning readers will be able to identify in the essay the main coordinates of the 2022 Philippine elections, some of which the authors got right but failed to bring together and thoroughly analyze.

First, the six-year term of incumbent president Duterte will end on June 30, 2022. Authoritarian-fascist in politics and neoliberal but also cronyist in economics, Duterte has consolidated his faction of the ruling classes, provided unprecedented gains to China while keeping the US happy and complacent, and has tightened control over the entire government — from the military and police to the courts and legislature. He has attacked in various forms all voices in the country that are independent and critical of his regime, from the media to the Catholic church, from civil society to the elite opposition — all in the context of non-stop killings of suspected drug addicts and pushers under the “war on drugs” and of left-wing activists and revolutionaries, as well as the hyper-active justification for these killings by government agencies using traditional and new media.

The strength of the Duterte faction of the ruling classes and the weakness of the elite opposition and other political forces critical of the government are favorable to the said faction actually prolonging itself in power beyond 2022. That faction has every motive to do so: from maintaining the wealth and power of politicians, military officers and businessmen who are close to it to shielding Duterte from accountability for his numerous and grave crimes to the Filipino people. Thanks to the initiative of the ND Left and various groups, the International Criminal Court could work to hold Duterte accountable for the killing of tens of thousands under his “war on drugs.”

Second, the frontrunner in the presidential race is Bongbong Marcos, Jr, former senator, son of dictator Ferdinand, and clearly Duterte’s anointed one. Since many months ago, he has enjoyed a wide lead over Robredo in the top opinion surveys. The Marcoses have been Duterte’s allies since the 2016 elections, he has repeatedly professed admiration for Marcos Jr’s father, his daughter Sara is running as Marcos Jr’s vice-president, and Marcos Jr has said that he will continue the current president’s programs.

Marcos faced-off with Robredo in the 2016 vice-presidential election and lost by more than 250,000 votes, only a small margin as they both received more than 14 million votes. Robredo is currently the leader of the elite opposition, which has increasingly been critical of the Duterte regime from a liberal-democratic viewpoint. While faring second in the opinion polls, she is getting the support of politicians, businessmen, leaders of the Catholic church, universities, and other groups.

Third, the Philippine Left has through the years been a minor player in the elections for the elite government in the Philippines. This is the result of the nature of such elections, which are dominated by “guns, goons, and gold,” to cite a classic description, owned by a few political dynasties. One avenue that various groupings in the Philippine Left have explored is the partylist system for the House of Representatives, which was designed as a corrective to the elitism of the elections and government and as a means to give voice to marginalized sectors of society. They have also fielded candidates for the Senate.

The partylist groups under Makabayan received 4.6 million votes in the 2019 elections, down from the 6.5 million in the 2016 elections — most probably a result of the Duterte regime’s various attacks. They won seven seats in Congress in 2016, and six seats in 2019. Colmenares, their senatorial candidate, garnered 6.5 million votes in 2016, and 4.7 million votes in 2019 — ranking 20th and 24th respectively, losing the race for 12 seats in the Senate in both instances. Believing that the main enemy of the Filipino people in the 2022 elections is the Marcos-Duterte faction of the ruling classes, Makabayan is supporting Robredo and her running mate senator Kiko Pangilinan.

Akbayan, meanwhile, received 608 thousand votes in 2016, getting one seat through the partylist system, and 172 thousand votes in 2019, failing to win a seat. Its senatorial candidate, social-democratic activist Risa Hontiveros, got 15.9 million votes in 2016, securing the ninth spot in the Senate race. Continuing its enduring alliance with the Liberal Party, Akbayan is also supporting the Robredo-Pangilinan tandem.

The democratic socialist formation which currently backs de Guzman and Bello also ran in previous elections. PLM got 29 thousand votes in 2019, failing to win a single Congressional seat. In his 2019 senatorial run, de Guzman received 894 thousand votes and landed in the 38th slot. Saying that it wants to fight the Duterte-Marcos tandem but also the ruling system in the country, change the Philippine Left’s tactics in dealing with bourgeois elections, and offer a progressive alternative to the electorate, PLM has fielded de Guzman and Bello as presidential and vice-presidential candidates, respectively.

Partido ng Manggagawa (PM) counted itself as part of the democratic socialist Left but has in recent years gravitated towards Akbayan. It received 43 thousand votes in 2016 and 28 thousand votes in 2019, failing to win a Congressional seat in both elections.

It is telling that the authors are putting forward a tactic but are not engaging in this kind of analysis of the political forces involved in the 2022 elections. One reason is that they seem to see the tactic of Leftists running as independent for president and vice-president as being useful not only for the present elections but also for future ones. Another reason is that a simple rundown like the one presented above can easily show that the de Guzman-Bello ticket is not strong enough to win.

Alvarez, Makalintal and Docena complain that the “lesser evil” tactic has been dominant in the Philippine Left. One of the reasons for this is that the bearers of that line, the ND Left, is the strongest group in that formation. It leads the biggest mass protests and mobilizations across the country, despite the Duterte regime and previous regimes’ violent attacks, and can, on its own, set the agenda of the Philippine Left.

The authors are speaking as outsiders to the ND movement, but instead of studying its many statements on the topic of Left engagement with the elections of the ruling classes — Sison’s writings on the topic are voluminous — they ascribe an explanation for the tactic from without: the Philippine Left’s weakness. They do not critique, and instead caricatures, the best justifications for the tactic that they criticize.

The ND Left considers the elections as a field dominated by the ruling classes in the Philippines — the big comprador capitalists and landlords subservient to US imperialism. These elections cannot, as such, be the main arena of the revolutionary struggle. They are only a secondary form of struggle to the year-long efforts to arouse, organize and mobilize the masses for national freedom and democracy. Even the number of votes stated above gives only a partial view of the Left’s strength in grassroots mobilization, the parliament of the streets, and many political spheres beyond the elections.

The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), armed rebel group New People’s Army or NPA and other underground member-organizations of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines — which all share the ND Left’s analysis of Philippine society — consider the armed revolution as the primary form of struggle. They do not participate in elections for the neocolonial ruling class government: they work underground in order to evade government repression and are building their own government. The distinction between legal progressive organizations and underground ones are crucial, and Alvarez, Makalintal and Docena are being irresponsible in describing the ND Left as “an alliance of parties, trade unions, and other groups associated with” the CPP. They are contributing to the regime’s redtagging of Makabayan and other legal progressive organizations.

In all its endeavors, the ND Left is guided by its class analysis of Philippine society, and it seeks to build a broad united front whereever possible. It aims to create the broadest unity against the narrowest target — at the national level, the ruling regime that represents and serves the imperialists and local ruling classes. Such a unity is a major way of weakening what it calls the semi-colonial, semi-feudal system in the country. Availing of existing conditions for creating a united front is especially useful in engaging in an electoral system that is dominated by the ruling classes — but where contradictions among them also play themselves out. Creating a united front is not an matter of strength or weakness for the ND Left, but a matter of principle.

Contrary to Alvarez, Makalintal and Docena’s claim, however, the ND Left does not consider Robredo a “dependable progressive ally.” It reserves such a category for other political entities and the Jacobin article authors will find it hard to pinpoint a categorical statement that would support this caricature of the ND Left’s classification of Robredo.

Again contrary to the authors’ claim, forging alliances with factions of the ruling classes, with Robredo’s faction in this case, does not mean that the Philippine Left is putting itself “in a vulnerable position that leaves [it] incapable of adequately opposing her inclination to compromise with the different parts of a regressive establishment, whether… big business or the military.” A key principle in building the united front that is cherished by the ND Left is “independence and initiative,” which justifies and even calls for criticisms of allies when they make statements or policies that run counter to the interests of the Filipino working classes and people.

So when, in the 2010 elections, businessman and senator Manny Villar, then the ally of Makabayan, forged an alliance with Marcos Jr, Makabayan criticized this move and campaigned most doggedly against the dictator’s son. When, after one year in power, Duterte showed that he would not really carry out his progressive promises to the Filipino people, the ND Left broke with him — and even led the protests against him that Alvarez, Makalintal and Docena attribute to the entire Philippine Left. The authors also exaggerate the problems with the ND Left’s alliances with Villar and Duterte, and minimize those with Akbayan’s alliance with the Noynoy Aquino regime — when the latter actually continued despite the regime’s crimes and anti-people policies, and resulted in the complete cooptation and weakening of Akbayan.

The tactic of building a broad united front against the narrowest target is even more correct in the 2022 elections. The Duterte regime is the worst ruling clique in the country’s history since the fall of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986 — in terms of puppetry to imperialist masters, service to its faction of the ruling class, corruption, economic policies harmful to the people especially amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, human rights violations, among others. It is most cunning in using its machinery of deception and repression. Now, it wants to enthrone the son of Marcos himself to continue its rule and even Marcos’ rule. Building a united front is necessary for the task of fighting and defeating the Marcos-Duterte tandem in the polls — which can be done effectively only by supporting the candidates that have a fighting chance to beat them, the Robredo-Pangilinan tandem.

The Jacobin article authors cite the following as reasons for the “weakening” of the Philippine Left: the “decimation of the country’s garment industry and other labor-intensive sectors,” “anti-labor legislation,” and “intensified… military offensives against communist guerillas.” They recognize the destruction of what used to be passed off as the country’s “industries” but refuse to look beyond the labor sector, part of their insistence that the country, despite their statement, is not semi-feudal anymore. It is odd that in citing these attacks launched by the ruling classes through the neocolonial state, they omit the massacres, extra-judicial killings, arrests on the basis of trumped-up charges, harassment, and militarization that unarmed activists and civilian communities experience.

They also mention “bloody purges and doctrinal debates” as reasons for the Left’s weakness. The bloody purges, the underground movement’s self-inflicted wounds, indeed brought about a weakening of the Left. But these have been assessed, lessons have been drawn, and some regions where purges were carried out have bounced back to strength at one point in time. Doctrinal debates, on the other hand, are necessary and fundamental, made imperative by Lenin’s famous dictum about revolutionary theory and movement, among others.

Alvarez, Makalintal and Docena want to present the causes of the supposed weakness of the Philippine Left but provide reasons affecting only the biggest and strongest formation in that grouping. Why have the other Left formations remained weak? Instead of self-reflection and self-criticism, they present an attack on the ND Left. In fact, the period from 1986 to the present is not characterized by a steady decline for the ND Left, unlike other Left formations in the Philippines. The ND movement has had advances in many fields, especially as a result of the Second Great Rectification Movement launched in 1992.

Even more oddly, the authors trace the government policies that they claim weakened the Left to the “restoration of democracy following the ‘People Power Revolution’ that removed Marcos” in 1986 which they say “simply reinforced the neoliberal restructuring of the Philippine economy.” That the successors of Marcos implemented neoliberal and repressive policies does not make the ouster of the US-backed Marcos fascist dictatorship — a feat achieved by more than two million Filipinos pouring into the streets for days — any less necessary and momentous.

The Edsa People Power uprising is less than a revolution, but still a weapon that the Filipino working classes and people have used and and can use to oust despotic, corrupt and anti-people presidents. It may not win Filipinos their long-term interests — national freedom, democracy, socialism — but it can win them their immediate interest of gaining relief from ruling regimes. It would be infinitely better if Filipinos do not have to fight to again replace a fascist dictatorial president with just a liberal-democratic one, but install a people’s democratic government. Yes, a genuine revolution is necessary and desirable — but this not possible in the 2022 elections. In fact, it may not be possible in any reactionary elections.

Alvarez, Makalintal and Docena criticize Robredo’s campaign program as offering, in essence, neoliberalism in the economy and liberal democracy in politics. They label her a “progressive neoliberal,” someone who “is opposed to authoritarianism but merely seeks to soften the neoliberal economic model rather than abolish it.”

A major issue that the authors fail to mention is that while Robredo favors resuming peace talks with the NDFP, she also said that she will retain the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict or NTF-Elcac, which has been dubbed as Duterte’s military junta and main coordinator of repression, despite widespread calls for its abolition. While this puts into question the authors’ claim that Robredo is “opposed to authoritarianism,” she on the whole mouths liberal-democratic principles. And underlying Alvarez, Makalintal and Docena’s essay is the failure to appreciate the difference between fascist and liberal-democratic leaders.

For Marxism, capitalist societies are ruled by the dictatorship of the capitalist class. In the Philippines, this translates to the dictatorship of big compradors and landlords that are subservient to US imperialism. Within this class dictatorship, there is a distinction between outright dictatorship by one faction of the ruling class on the one hand, and situations where factions of the ruling class pretend to uphold liberal democracy, on the other — where they can “peacefully” compete for power and there is respect, however limited, for human rights and rule of law.

In his Marxism and Politics [1977], political theorist Ralph Miliband says that Marx, Engels and Lenin, all made a distinction between “dictatorships” and “bourgeois democratic regimes” — even as they are clear that these are all forms of capitalist class rule that must be overthrown. While critical of bourgeois democratic regimes, Marx criticized “Bonapartist” or dictatorial rule more heavily, and Engels recognized that the bourgeois democratic regimes provide the working class with various weapons, including suffrage, to advance its revolutionary struggle. Lenin, meanwhile, at first pinned his hope on a bourgeois revolution against Tsarist rule in Russia and recognized the emergence of bourgeois democratic regimes in other countries. He even said in one instance that “We are in favor of a democratic republic as the best form of state for the proletariat under capitalism.”

Miliband, in summary, says that “In Marxist thought, bourgeois democracy, for all its class limitations, remained a vastly superior form of state to any existing alternative.” He considers the failure to make a distinction between bourgeois democratic regimes and dictatorships as an instance of “ultra-left deviation,” which of course objectively strengthens the class enemy. He calls for understanding, as opposed to simply dismissing, this deviation. He calls attention to “an attitude of mind to which Marxists have been prone” — “the belief that because A and B are not totally different, they are not really different at all.”

Closer to home, Mao Zedong theorized new democracy as the basic completion of the the bourgeois-democratic revolution under the class leadership of the proletariat and in the direction of the socialist revolution, asserting that conditions in China do not allow the establishment of a bourgeois democracy. This is a recognition that some elements of bourgeois democracy, especially agrarian revolution, can be compatible with a socialist politics under the leadership of the working class. In the Philippines, the difference between Marcos’ open fascist rule and successive regimes’ pretention to liberal democracy is reflected in concrete terms in the existence of institutions from the media to the legislature, in the open functioning of progressive organizations and NGOs, and in at least the regimes’ lip service to human rights and rule of law.

The distinction, ironically, was also sharply presented in Bello’s influential essay “Rodrigo Duterte: A Fascist Original” [2017] in which he says that Duterte satisfies the four criteria of a fascist leader that he laid down. One particularity of Duterte, however, is that “he is not waging a counterrevolution against the left or socialism,” which is debatable, but against “liberal democracy, the dominant ideology and system of our time,” which is beyond dispute.

So ultimately, an elite politician who champions liberal democracy is better than a politician who is a fascist and champions dictatorship — especially an incumbent who rules like a fascist dictator. Even “softer neoliberalism” is better than a “hardcore” one. One certainly hopes that, if elected, Robredo won’t become another Duterte — but her election would at the very least disrupt the functioning of the Duterte regime’s machinery of anti-people governance.

For leftists who train their sights on a radical change and alternative, these distinctions may seem minor, and making them like scraping the bottom of the barrel. But these differences matter to the working classes and people who will find themselves living, working and struggling within fundamentally the same socio-economic conditions after the elections. They also matter in an arena of struggle — the elections — where only little can be done to advance the interests of the working classes and people. Herein lies the moment of truth of the much-reviled “lesser evil” electoral tactic.

Somewhere in their essay, Alvarez, Makalintal and Docena claim that the reason for the ND Left’s support for Robredo is that “she will at least provide the country’s progressives with some breathing space to rebuild their strength in the years ahead.” They make it appear that the ND movement supports factions of the ruling elite during elections primarily because of its possible gains as a political force. Reading the ND Left’s statements on elections will show that it builds such alliances on the basis of the immediate interests of the Filipino working classes and people. This groundedness in the masses and their interest is one of the sources of the said movement’s inexhaustible hope that it can strengthen itself whether the ruling regime is dictatorial or pretends to be liberal-democratic.

For the ND Left, the benefits of the de Guzman-Bello campaign cited by Alvarez, Makalintal and Docena — offering “a revolutionary perspective” and creating “political and organizational infrastructure” — can be attained more effectively in the context of immediate and urgent struggles. Without a connection to such struggles, all talk about the “ruling system” and “radical alternative” can become talking over the heads of the masses — even as it excites some “woke” middle-class youths on social media.

The immediate and urgent struggle in the 2022 elections is ending the dictatorial rule of the Marcoses and Dutertes; it is the starting point for raising the consciousness of the working classes and people. The Robredo-Pangilinan campaign, on its own and with the help of Makabayan, has attracted the active support of many socially-conscious Filipinos, as seen in the tens of thousands who have recently flocked to its campaign rallies.

In contrast to the ND Left’s approach of building the broadest unity against the narrowest target and using the contradictions among factions of the ruling class to the Filipino people’s advantage, Alvarez, Makalintal and Docena — as well as some writers and organizations in the broad Philippine Left — advocate not taking sides in these contradictions, and instead forwarding a criticism of the dominant socio-economic system and a program of a progressive alternative, in what could be seen as an interpretation of the principle of working class independence from the ruling classes.

Alvarez, Makalintal and Docena say that the de Guzman-Bello campaign is “claim[ing] and tak[ing] up space outside the constraints of the permissible and set[ting] its own frames of reference, instead of capitulating to the terms of others.”

One is reminded of the famous quote from Marxist cultural theorist Fredric Jameson: “History is what hurts, it is what refuses desire and sets inexorable limits to individual as well as collective praxis, which its ‘ruses’ turn into grisly and ironic reversals of their overt intention.… History as ground and untranscendable horizon needs no particular theoretical justification: we may be sure that its alienating necessities will not forget us, however much we might prefer to ignore them [The Political Unconscious, 1981].”

"Progressives sue Lorraine Badoy over red-tagging spree","MANILA – Three sets of complaints were filed against National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) National Spokesperson Lorraine Badoy before the Office of the Ombudsman today, March 23.

This after Badoy red-tagged Vice President and presidential candidate Leni Robredo and her supporters on social media.

“She alleges that Vice President Robredo is a supporter of the CPP-NPA, without offering any evidence except for expressions of support from groups belonging to the left side of the political spectrum and her willingness to resume peace talks with rebel groups,” Movement Against Disinformation said in a statement.

The first set of complaints were filed by former Kabataan Party-list Representative Raymond Palatino, Daily Tribune editor Pocholo Mercado Concepcion and Delfin Castro Jr., brother of Dr. Natividad Castro.

The second was filed by Alliance of Concerned Teachers-National Capital Region and Region 10 Unions and the third was by the National Union of Students in the Philippines (NUSP).

The complaints against Badoy include violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, RA 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees and the Omnibus Election Code.

In his statement to the media, Palatino said that Badoy’s posts on social media targets the ordinary people and activists.

“The problem with these kinds of statements is that they are using their position to spread intrigues which endangers the lives of the people,” Palatino said.

“Badoy has used and continues to use the machinery of the state media to influence and deceive voters like us. This is openly red-tagging and slander against VP Robredo, the Makabayan Bloc, and any candidate and people who support VP’s candidacy, using the people’s money and resources — something that is against not only the law but the Constitution,” said Vladimer Quetua, president of the ACT-NCR Union.

For Ophelia Tabacon, former president of ACT-Region 10 Union, said that Badoy must be taught an important lesson: “Spreading lies online is as bad as spreading lies offline. A gossipmonger and fake news spreader must not be allowed to serve as spokesperson of any agency, or even be allowed any post in government service.”

“These lessons are more urgent in the case of red-tagging because such lies and fake news endanger the lives of the targets, be they politicians or ordinary citizens,” Tabacon said.

Tabacon was forced to resign in 2020 due to incessant red-tagging against her. She and 16 other human rights defenders in Cagayan De Oro City were slapped with trumped-up charges that were eventually dismissed in December last year.

Meanwhile, Palatino said that Badoy must be suspended from her post until President Duterte’s term ends.

Prior to this complaint, several cause oriented groups, lawyers, and media groups have filed complaints before the Office of the Ombudsman against Badoy and her former colleague, retired Lt. Gen. Antonio Parlade, Jr.

Groups are strongly protesting the red-tagging made by officials of the government as it has resulted in the killing or, if not, arbitrary arrests and detention of activists in the current and past administrations. (RTS, RVO)

"Taxi, jeepney drivers can barely feed families over oil price hike","DAVAO CITY, Philippines — Taxi and jeepney drivers are struggling about how to make ends meet in the pandemic which is compounded with this week’s big-time oil price hike by oil companies.

Leoncio Racaba, a taxicab driver, scratches his head as he passes by a gasoline station in R. Castillo Street after seeing the petroleum prices now reach P80. Fuel prices have risen around P25 since January this year, and he says they’ll be nothing left in his income driving his cab.

Rabaca, age 59, has been driving a taxicab for 15 years and is the only supporting his family. Since the pandemic he has been driving his taxi for almost 24 hours a day to double his income that will sustain their daily needs and set aside a portion for his medical maintenance.

But this week Rabaca said “it is almost impossible” to put food on their table because his earnings were almost entirely spent on gasoline and car rental.

“Wala na gyud ma’am, hasta nang hangaka. Bisan pag di na ko matulog ani sige na lang kog drive di na ko mukita og usa libo pasaka. Sa una kaya kaya pa man to bisan Covid, pero karon noon nga mas daghan daghan na musakay og taxi, ning mahal man pud noon ka grabe ang gasoline,” Rabaca said.

(I’ll have nothing left; I’m gasping. Even if I’m losing sleep driving for days I can’t earn P1,000 or more. It was manageable even during Covid, but now when people are looking for a taxi, the fuel price has shoot up.)

From October to December last year, Rabaca said he takes home at least a minimum of P700 a day and pays his daily car rental worth P800.

But since January of this year, Rabaca said his operator decided to increase his rental to P1,100 due to expensive maintenance and gas price.

“Dati mga October to December sa 20 liters nga akong maconsume sa tibuok adlaw naa pay mabilin sa akoa gamay. Karon mga P800 pud gud ang nadugang sa among igahin pang gas lang,” he added.

(Last October to December, my driving for the whole day would consume 20 liters, but I still have enough to take home. But now I need to pay an additional P300 for the fuel.)

In January this year, Racaba spent P1, 300 for gasoline, then P1, 600 in February, and this month he spends P2,000 and sometimes more.

Jeepney drivers are also spending more and earning less due to the oil price hike, said transport leader Larry Arguilles of Transmission-Piston Southern Mindanao.

Arguilles said that a jeepney traveling within the downtown area consumes one liter per round-trip, but for the whole day the jeepney will consume a minimum of 15 liters.

Jeepney drivers also take few passengers in the pandemic, around six to 10 passengers per trip. Their earnings are affected also by daily heavy traffic.

“Ang iya ra gyud madala sa kada round trip naa ra gyud sa kapin gatus ug samtang ang ihayang arkila nasa P400 kung jeep, asa man kuhaon karon sa driver ang iyang income aron madala sa iyang pamilya?” Arguilles asked.

(They can only earn P400 per round trip, now where else can he earn other income for their families?)

During their protest action on the big day of oil price hike on Wednesday, Transmission-Piston Southern Mindanao along with progressive groups in the city called for the suspension of the excise tax that they said drives the increase of oil prices in the Philippine market.

“If the government suspends the excise tax and VAT on fuel products, almost Php 20/liter will be deducted for Gasoline and Php 10/liter for Diesel.”

The group also calls to repeal the R.A. 8479 or the Downstream Oil Deregulation Act of 1998 and pushed to divert the budget of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) to give priority assistance to the affected sectors. Kath Cortez/davaotoday.com

"Coca-Cola workers receive invite to ‘surrender as Reds’ – labor group","SANTA CRUZ, Laguna – Several workers at the Coca-Cola plant in Santa Rosa, Laguna province received text messages inviting them to a mysterious event, according to labor center Pagkakaisa ng Manggagawa sa Timog Katagalugan (PAMANTIK-KMU).

In a March 18 report, PAMANTIK-KMU noted that an unknown number texted several Coca-Cola workers inviting them to an “oath taking” ceremony on March 29 at the PNP Region 4A headquarters in Camp Vicente Lim, Calamba, Laguna.

The group noted in its statement that last May 1, 2020, at least 16 Coca-Cola workers were invited to a similar event, which turned out to be a ceremony to present them as ‘surrenderees’ of the New People’s Army (NPA).

Prior to that, a similar “surrender ceremony” was conducted last March 29, 2020, also on Camp Vicente Lim. The incident involved 40 Coca-Cola workers who were presented as ‘NPA surrenderees.’

March 29 is a notable date because it is the anniversary of the New People’s Army. The NPA will have existed for 53 years this month.

PAMANTIK-KMU condemned the incident, stating that the workers of Coca-Cola only want “to be regularized at their workplace and receive a living wage.”

Since the start of the COVID-19 induced lockdown last March 2020, Coca-Cola workers in particular suffered repeated instances of threats, harassment, intimidation, and attempts to destroy their union. These range from attempts to dissuade them from joining the union, to visits from NTF-ELCAC personnel, to forced ‘surrender’ ceremonies in police camps such as Camp Vicente Lim and Camp Macario Sakay in Los Baños, Laguna.

In one instance last December 2021, unidentified people posted flyers around Santa Rosa and Cabuyao with the names and pictures of Coca-Cola workers. The flyers implied that they are members of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).

The attacks against Coca-Cola workers form a larger pattern of attacks against workers in the region, added PAMANTIK-KMU. From March 2020 to March 2022, there have been no less than 36 incidents against workers and unionists in Southern Tagalog, mostly concentrated in the province of Laguna.

There is a regular pattern in the nature of attacks against unionists, escalating from visits in the workplace and home visitations to the filing of trumped up charges, and in the worst instance, extrajudicial murder. In at least three instances, state agents have made it a point to dissuade workers from affiliating themselves with OLALIA-KMU, and have so far been ‘successful’ in two – Aichi Forge Philippines and Sun Logistics Philippines.

Despite the attacks, however, PAMANTIK-KMU asserts that unionism is a right. “The right to decent wages, benefits, and job security is something every worker should enjoy,” said Mia Antonio, PAMANTIK-KMU spokesperson in a statement to Bulatlat.

“Unions are integral to the struggle for those rights, because without a union, what do workers have?” she added. Antonio asserted that the attacks against workers and unionists is an “attack against the basic rights of workers” and serves “the interests of capital.” (RVO)

"FACT CHECK: Senators receive P20 billion for pet projects, Harry Roque claims","During a UniTeam campaign rally in Bataan last March 17, former presidential spokesperson and senatorial candidate Harry Roque told the audience that each senator receives P20 billion worth of projects annually. He went on to say that he if wins a seat in the Senate, he will allocate projects to Bataan.

At 1:52:11 mark in this video posted by the Facebook page 1Bataan, Roque is seen saying, “Hindi pa po tayo nakakatikim ng senador na taga-Bataan. At dahil d’yan, hindi pa natin alam na ang pondo ng isang senador sa mga proyekto, umaabot ng P20 billion. Bataan, gusto n’yo ba ng P20 billion o hindi?”

CLAIM:

Senators get P20 billion for pet projects, senatorial candidate Harry Roque claims

RATING:

FALSE

FACTS:

A cursory reading of the national budget documents would reveal that senators are not expressly given any allocation for discretionary programs or projects because the Supreme Court declared the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) unconstitutional back in 2013.

PDAF, commonly called “pork barrel,” figured in a long-drawn controversy involving legislators who allegedly misused and pocketed billions worth of funds through ghost projects implemented through various nefarious conduits, including bogus non-government organizations set up by controversial Janet Lim Napoles.

While the former presidential spokesperson, who is running under the ticket of former Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr., did not mention PDAF or the term “pork barrel” in his speech, it was clear that he was referring to the said controversial discretionary budget. What Roque failed to mention – or may have conveniently left out in his speech – is that it is illegal for senators to tap such funds for their pet projects. For Roque to promise P20 billion worth of projects for Bataan from a supposedly defunct budget system is suspect.

While it is erroneous to claim that each senator is allotted P20 billion for projects, the public has been largely left in the dark on what really happens on the ground. Despite the 2013 SC decision, several exposés have been brought to light in recent years proving that the pork barrel system still exists. There are various estimates on how much legislators still “realign” during congressional hearings to fund their pet projects. In 2019, no less than the chairperson of the House Committee on Appropriations, Camarines Sur Rep. Rolando Andaya Jr., bared that the Senate realigned a total of P83.6 billion in government funds, to allegedly finance new variants of the pork barrel system.

WHY IT MATTERS:

For decades, candidates running for office promise voters funding for projects in their localities in exchange for support. Yet, it should be stressed that implementing publicly funded projects is not part of the tasks of senators, as stipulated in the 1987 Constitution. While senators are indeed involved in the national budget process, claiming control over portions of the public coffers for their own pet projects have been known to lead to large-scale political corruption and tolerate well-entrenched patronage politics. -Rome Medina & Neil Dizon

"FACT CHECK: Reported harassment & forced evacuation of Lumad groups in Mindanao only for ‘show,’ former Lumad leader claims","A former Lumad leader, Jong Monzon, who used to serve as secretary-general of the “Pasakaday Salugpongan Kalimodan” (PASAKA), was featured recently in an article published by the Philippine News Agency (PNA), where he claimed that Lumad groups are working in cahoots with the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) to act and put on a show that could create an illusion that indigenous peoples in Mindanao are constantly experiencing harassment.

In a virtual press conference organized by the Philippine Army’s 701st Brigade together with the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC), Monzon claimed that the CPP-NPA orchestrated the wave of evacuation of Lumad groups in the past years, supposedly exploiting the indigenous peoples to “gain financing for their anti-government activities.”

Monzon further claimed that the Lumad groups that sought refuge in the United Church of Christ – Haran (UCCP – Haran) in Davao City were only posing as “bakwits” (evacuees) as part of the so-called ploy designed by the CPP-NPA.

CLAIM:

Lumad groups who have evacuated from their ancestral domain in recent years are only putting up a show under the behest of the CPP-NPA, claims former Lumad leader Jong Monzon.

RATING:

FALSE

FACTS:

Monzon’s testimony made it appear that reported incidents on the continued harassment of Lumad communities in Mindanao, many of which caused the forced evacuation of indigenous peoples’ groups from their ancestral lands, were all for “show.” A cursory review of reported incidents reveal otherwise.

Since the Duterte administration assumed power in 2016, at least 300 unarmed IPs and human rights defenders have been killed by military forces. Just last June 2021, three civilians from the Lumad Manobo tribe were raped and killed in Surigao del Sur– including a 12-year-old child.

In January 2020, an armed paramilitary group attacked the UCCP – Haran, forcibly entering the grounds of the church. Jong Monzon himself, as the then secretary-general of PASAKA, said in a statement that the paramilitary group was armed with bolos and accompanied by men who were suspected as state agents.

The UCCP-Haran in Davao City, mentioned by Monzon, has been an evacuation site for bakwits since 1994. The said church has served more than 600 bakwits since 2014, including Lumads who fled their ancestral lands because of military harassment and attacks.

The PNA article itself noted that Monzon “surrendered to authorities in Boston town, Davao Oriental, on March 8,” a detail that should be investigated further, as the former Lumad leader has made a brisk and complete turnaround on his public statements ever since he reportedly surrendered.



WHY THIS MATTERS:

Attacks against Lumad communities in Mindanao, and groups who provide aid to them, have been unrelenting throughout recent years.

UCCP-Haran, which served as one of the main sanctuaries of bakwits, experienced such attacks recently. Claiming that the funds of UCCP-Haran were being “used to finance terrorism,” the Anti-Money Laundering Council froze three of their bank accounts, in accordance to a resolution they issued on March 12, 2021.

Aside from the coordinated moves meant to close down UCCP-Haran, various government agencies have also launched unrelenting campaigns to vilify Lumad groups in Mindanao, with no less than the National Commission on Indigenous People (NCIP) branding the word “Lumad” as a terrorist term. All these coordinated attacks have led to the closure of Lumad schools, continued forced evacuation of Lumad groups from their ancestral lands, and numerous arrests and killings. –Maez Estrada and Joseph Gloria

"FACT CHECK: Pamilya Marcos, kinidnap matapos ang EDSA People Power?","Isang TikTok video mula sa user na si @norte_2k ang nagsasabing kinidnap daw ang pamilya Marcos matapos ang EDSA People Power noong 1986. Sa nasabing video, makikita ang pinagtagpi-tagping video mula sa ibang balita at dokumentaryo, kabilang na ang panayam kay Imelda Marcos mula sa dokumentaryong “The Kingmaker.” Ani Imelda, “It is not true that we fled from our country, we were kidnapped. They told us we were going to Paoay, a town in Ilocos, only to be brought to Hawaii.” (Hindi totoong umalis kami ng bansa. Ang sabi sa amin, pupunta kami sa Paoay, isang bayan sa Ilocos, pero dinala kami sa Hawaii.)

Kalakip ng video ang caption na, “Pina-kidnap ang pamilya Marcos, hindi nila iniwan ang Pinas! Andaming nauto ng mga Aquino.”

ANG SABI-SABI:

Kinidnap ang pamilya Marcos matapos ang EDSA People Power noong 1986

MARKA:

HINDI TOTOO

ANG KATOTOHANAN:

Noong Pebrero 25, 1986, matapos ang negosasyon kay Marcos Sr. na bumaba sa puwesto, ipinaalam ni US ambassador Stephen Bosworth kay dating Pangulong Cory Aquino na nakumbinsi si Marcos Sr. na umalis ng bansa sa pamamagitan ng pagtanggap nito sa alok ng mga Amerikano na umalis ng Malacañang. Gayunpaman, wala pang napag-usapang destinasyon para sa pamilya Marcos noonsa puntong iyon.

Sa kabila ng desisyon ni Marcos Sr. na “mamatay sa Palasyo,” nakiusap ang mga babaeng anak niya na lumulan na sila ng helicopter sa Clark at “umalis na patungong US.” Paliwanag nila, maaari kasing hindi na sila makalalabas nang buhay sa Malacañang kapag nanatili sila doon. Patunay itong hindi kinidnap ng mga Amerikano ang pamilya Marcos. Sa ulat ng Associated Press , hindi nagreklamo si Marcos Sr. nang dumating sila sa teritoryo ng US. Nang lumapag sila sa Hawaii noong Pebrero 26, nakipagpulong pa siya nang isang oras kasama ang state governor doon na si George Ariyoshi.

"FACT CHECK: NAIA, PGH, TESDA, SSS, at GSIS, si Marcos Sr. ang nagtayo?","Isang TikTok video mula 2021 na naglalaman ng mga pahayag tungkol sa dating diktador na si Ferdinand Marcos ang muling kumakalat sa iba’t ibang social media platforms. Isa sa mga pangunahing pinangangalandakan ng video ay na ipinagawa umano ng dating diktador ang Manila International Airport (MIA), na kalauna’y pinangalanang Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), at ang Philippine General Hospital (PGH) na nasa Maynila. Itinatag din umano ng administrasyong Marcos ang ilang ahensya ng gobyerno kabilang ang Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), Social Security System (SSS), at ang Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), at iba pa.



ANG SABI-SABI:

Administrasyon ng yumaong diktador na si Ferdinand Marcos ang nagpatayo sa NAIA at PGH, at nagtatag ng ilang ahensya ng gobyerno kabilang ang TESDA, SSS, at GSIS.





MARKA:

HINDI TOTOO

ANG KATOTOHANAN:



Bagama’t ang ilang importanteng pagsasaayos at pagpapaunlad ng imprastraktura para sa MIA – na ngayo’y tinatawag na NAIA – ay tunay na ginawa sa ilalim ng administrasyong Marcos, hindi totoong administrasyon niya ang nagpatayo nito. Gumagana na ang paliparan ilang taon bago pa man ang manungkulan si Marcos bilang pangulo. Ang airport complex na matatagpuan sa lungsod ng Pasay at Parañaque, ay nasa operasyon na matapos itong ilipat noong 1948 mula sa dating lokasyon sa Grace Park Airfield sa Caloocan City.

Samantala, ang PGH ay ipinatayo noong 1907 sa bisa ng Philippine Commission Act No. 1688, at binuksan sa publiko noong 1910.

Ang TESDA naman itinatag sa bisa ng Republic Act No. 7796 na pinirmahan ni dating Pangulong Fidel V. Ramos noong 1994. Sa kabilang banda, ang SSS ay naitatag noong 1954 sa pamamagitan ng Republic Act No. 1164. At ang Government Insurance System (GSIS) ay naitatag sa pamamagitan ng Commonwealth Act No.186, na ipinasa ng National Assembly noong 1936.

BAKIT KAILANGAN I-FACT-CHECK:

Kilala ang administrasyong Marcos sa pagkakaroon ng tinatawag na “edifice complex,” dahil napakaraming proyektong imprastraktura ang pinasok ng nasabing administrasyon. Gayunman, isiniwalat ng iba’t ibang dokumento na ang marami sa mga proyektong ito ay hindi lamang nagpalobo sa foreign debt ng bansa mula sa $360 milyon nang magsimula ang administrasyong Marcos noong 1962, hanggang sa humigit-kumulang $28.3 bilyon noong siya ay mapatalsik noong 1986, kundi naging pangunahing pinanggagalingan din ng “gross overspending, garishness, and corruption.”

Dahil sa mahabang listahan ng mga proyektong pang-imprastraktura ng administrasyong Marcos, naging madali para sa ilan na magdagdag ng mga proyekto sa listahan kahit hindi talaga iyon ipinagawa ni Marcos, gaya ng ginawa sa TikTok video na siniyasat. Ang Tiktok user na si @marymy143 na nag-upload ng video ay mayroon ding 93.6 thousand followers, at umabot na sa 788,800 views, 91,000 likes, 6,082 comments, at 4,765 shares ang video. – Joemilyn Abareta & Ma.

"FALSE: Philippines developed the ‘strongest war weapon in the world’ under the late dictator’s presidency","A TikTok video from 2021 is again making rounds on social media, carrying with it a list of claims, one of which is that the Philippines has developed the “strongest war weapon in the world” under the term of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.

CLAIM:

Under the term of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the Philippines developed one of the strongest war weapons in the world – “Bongbong 1” – a missile rocket developed under the “Santa Barbara Project.”

RATING:

FALSE

FACTS:

While the Marcos administration has indeed ordered the development of multiple types of missiles under the classified “Santa Barbara Project,” little has been known about the so-called “Bongbong 1” rocket, thus there is no basis to say it is one of the strongest war weapons in the world, as the video claims. There is a mention, however, in the 1972 almanac of US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of “Bongbong II,” which it described as the country’s “first liquid-propellant rocket” but no evidence has been shown to ascertain its fire power.

The Santa Barbara Project was discontinued after the Marcos administration, for undisclosed reasons, and the Bongbong rockets’ fate has never been fully disclosed. Despite the existence of such classified weapons development project decades before, the Philippines remains to have “weaknesses in territorial defense,” as the Philippine Air Force admits in their strategic plan called “Flight Plan 2028.”

WHY THIS MATTERS:

Amid the escalating dispute in the West Philippine Sea, territorial defense has become one of the hotly debated topics during the 2022 campaign season. Unverified claims that the country has once developed strong war weapons only not only veer the debate away from key issues but may also lead to further confusion. The TikTok user @marymy143 who uploaded the video has 93,600 thousand followers, and as of writing, the video has reached 788,800 thousand views and continues to circulate in various social networking platforms. – Joemilyn Abareta & Ma.

"FACT CHECK: Were the Marcoses kidnapped after the 1986 EDSA People Power?","A TikTok video posted by @norte_2k claims that the Marcoses were kidnapped after the 1986 EDSA People Power. The video showed various spliced footages, including an interview of Imelda Marcos taken from the documentary film The Kingmaker. She said, “It is not true that we fled from our country, we were kidnapped. They told us we were going to Paoay, a town in Ilocos, only to be brought to Hawaii.”

The video was posted with the caption, “Pina-kidnap ang pamilya Marcos, hindi nila iniwan ang Pinas! Andaming nauto ng mga Aquino.”

CLAIM:

The Marcoses were kidnapped after 1986 EDSA People Power

RATING:

FALSE

FACTS:

On February 25, 1986, after the negotiations for the late Marcos Sr. to step down, US ambassador Stephen Bosworth informed then-President Cory Aquino that Marcos Sr. was persuaded to leave the country by accepting the Americans’ offer to leave Malacañang. However, there was no discussed destination yet.

Despite Marcos Sr.’s decision to “die in the Palace,” his daughters pleaded for him to take the helicopter to Clark and “make the departure for the US.” They reasoned that they could not possibly come out of Malacañang alive. This proves that the Marcoses were not kidnapped by the Americans. According to the Associated Press, Marcos Sr. certainly made no complaint when he first arrived in US territory. When he landed in Hawaii on February 26, he met for an hour with the state’s governor, George Ariyoshi.

WHY IT MATTERS:

As of writing, the TikTok video has over 202,800 views, 21,500 likes, 788 comments, and 575 shares. The account itself is followed by 1,230 users. – Philip Mateo

"FACT CHECK: NAIA, PGH, TESDA, SSS, & GSIS established under Marcos administration?","A TikTok video from 2021 loaded with a ton of claims about the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos has again made rounds recently. One of the key claims of the video is that the late dictator built the Manila International Airport (MIA), which was eventually renamed as the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), the Philippine General Hospital in Manila, and even instituted several government agencies including the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), the Social Security System (SSS), and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), among others.

CLAIM:

The late dictator Ferdinand Marcos spearheaded the construction of NAIA and PGH, and instituted key government agencies including TESDA, SSS, and GSIS.

RATING:

FALSE

FACTS:

While improvements and several infrastructure developments for MIA – now called NAIA – has indeed been done under the Marcos administration, the airport has in fact been in operation years before his presidency. The airport complex located in the cities of Pasay and Parañaque, has been in operation after its transfer in 1948 from the former location in Grace Park Airfield in Caloocan City.

Meanwhile, the PGH was created in 1907 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1688, and was opened to the public by September 1910.

The TESDA was established by virtue of Republic Act No. 7796 signed by former President Fidel V, Ramos in 1994. The SSS, on the other hand, was established in 1954 through the passage of Republic Act No. 1164. Also, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) was created through Commonwealth Act No.186, which was passed by the National Assembly in 1936.

WHY THIS MATTERS:

The Marcos administration has been known for having an “edifice complex,” as his administration has indeed spearheaded the construction of several big-ticket infrastructure. However, various documents reveal that these projects not only ballooned the country’s foreign debt from $360 million when Marcos came into power in 1962, to around $28.3 billion when he was ousted in 1986, the projects have also become major sources of “gross overspending, garishness, and corruption.”

Due to the long list of infrastructure projects initiated by the Marcos administration, it has become easy for some to conveniently add projects to that list, just as what the TikTok video in question has done. The Tiktok user @marymy143 who uploaded the video also has 93.6 thousand followers, and as of writing, the video has reached 788,800 views, 91,000 likes, 6,082 comments, and 4,765 shares. – Joemilyn Abareta & Ma.
